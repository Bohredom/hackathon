            <div id="desc">Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, is a NASA space observatory designed to detect gamma-ray
                bursts (GRBs). It was launched on November 20, 2004. The Swift observatory comprises three telescopes,
                which work in tandem to provide rapid identification and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRBs and their
                afterglows. Within 20 to 75 seconds of a detected GRB, the observatory rotates autonomously, so the
                onboard X-ray and optical telescopes can view the burst. The afterglow phenomenon follows the initial
                gamma-ray flash in most bursts. It can linger in X-ray light, optical light and radio waves for hours to
                weeks, providing great detail and SWIFT basically aims to detect all these with it is detailed
                instruments.</div>

            <div id="title">What is Gamma Ray Bursts?</div>
            <div id="desc">Gamma-ray bursts are the strongest and brightest explosions in the universe, thought to be
                generated during the formation of black holes. Though they last mere seconds, gamma-ray bursts produce
                as much energy as the sun will emit during its entire 10-billion-year existence.
                The enigmatic phenomena were first seen in 1967 by a U.S. Air Force satellite called Vela. The probe was
                designed to keep watch for secret Soviet nuclear testing, but it ended up spotting dazzling gamma-rays —
                the most powerful electromagnetic radiation — coming from beyond the solar system, according to NASA

            <div id="title">What is X-Ray?</div>
            <div id="desc">X-rays are types of electromagnetic radiation and X-rays are roughly classified into soft
                X-rays and hard X-rays. Soft X-rays have relatively short wavelengths of about 10 nanometers (a
                nanometer is one-billionth of a meter), and so they fall in the range of the electromagnetic (EM)
                spectrum between ultraviolet (UV) light and gamma-rays. Hard X-rays have wavelengths of about 100
                picometers (a picometer is one-trillionth of a meter).</div>

            <div id="title">What is Ultraviolet?</div>
            <div id="desc">Ultraviolet (UV) is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelength from 10 nm (with a
                corresponding frequency of approximately 30 PHz) to 400 nm (750 THz), shorter than that of visible light
                but longer than X-rays. UV radiation is present in sunlight, and constitutes about 10% of the total
                electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. The electromagnetic spectrum of ultraviolet radiation
                (UVR), defined most broadly as 10–400 nanometers because of that reason it can be subdivided in a wide
                range.</div>
