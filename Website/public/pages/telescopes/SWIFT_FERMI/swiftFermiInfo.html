            <div id="desc">Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, is a NASA space observatory designed to detect gamma-ray
                bursts (GRBs). It was launched on November 20, 2004. The Swift observatory comprises three telescopes,
                which work in tandem to provide rapid identification and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRBs and their
                afterglows. Within 20 to 75 seconds of a detected GRB, the observatory rotates autonomously, so the
                onboard X-ray and optical telescopes can view the burst. The afterglow phenomenon follows the initial
                gamma-ray flash in most bursts. It can linger in X-ray light, optical light and radio waves for hours to
                weeks, providing great detail and SWIFT basically aims to detect all these with it is detailed
                instruments.</div>

            <div id="title">The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</div>
            <div id="desc">NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a powerful space observatory that opens a wide
                window on the universe. Gamma rays are the highest-energy form of light, and the gamma-ray sky is
                spectacularly different from the one we perceive with our own eyes. Fermi enables scientists to answer
                persistent questions across a broad range of topics, including supermassive black-hole systems, pulsars,
                the origin of cosmic rays, and searches for signals of new physics.
                Astronomers at long last have a superior tool to study how black holes, notorious for pulling matter in,
                can accelerate jets of gas outward at fantastic speeds. Physicists are able to study subatomic particles
                at energies far greater than those seen in ground-based particle accelerators. And cosmologists are
                gaining valuable information about the birth and early evolution of the Universe.
                More technically, Fermi observes light in the photon energy range of 8,000 electronvolts (8 keV) to
                greater than 300 billion electronvolts (300 GeV). An electronvolt is a unit of energy close to that of
                visible light; Fermi observes photons with energy levels thousands to hundreds of billions of times
                greater than what the unaided eye can see.
                When launched on June 11, 2008, Fermi bore the name Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope, or GLAST. NASA
                renamed the mission that August in honor of professor Enrico Fermi (1901-1954), a pioneer in high-energy
                physics.

            <div id="title">What is Gamma Ray Bursts?</div>
            <div id="desc">Gamma-ray bursts are the strongest and brightest explosions in the universe, thought to be
                generated during the formation of black holes. Though they last mere seconds, gamma-ray bursts produce
                as much energy as the sun will emit during its entire 10-billion-year existence.
                The enigmatic phenomena were first seen in 1967 by a U.S. Air Force satellite called Vela. The probe was
                designed to keep watch for secret Soviet nuclear testing, but it ended up spotting dazzling gamma-rays —
                the most powerful electromagnetic radiation — coming from beyond the solar system, according to NASA

            <div id="title">What is X-Ray?</div>
            <div id="desc">X-rays are types of electromagnetic radiation and X-rays are roughly classified into soft
                X-rays and hard X-rays. Soft X-rays have relatively short wavelengths of about 10 nanometers (a
                nanometer is one-billionth of a meter), and so they fall in the range of the electromagnetic (EM)
                spectrum between ultraviolet (UV) light and gamma-rays. Hard X-rays have wavelengths of about 100
                picometers (a picometer is one-trillionth of a meter).</div>

            <div id="title">What is Ultraviolet?</div>
            <div id="desc">Ultraviolet (UV) is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelength from 10 nm (with a
                corresponding frequency of approximately 30 PHz) to 400 nm (750 THz), shorter than that of visible light
                but longer than X-rays. UV radiation is present in sunlight, and constitutes about 10% of the total
                electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. The electromagnetic spectrum of ultraviolet radiation
                (UVR), defined most broadly as 10–400 nanometers because of that reason it can be subdivided in a wide
                range.</div>
