                oscillating

                aimed to close the gap between our current technical capability and our knowledge of the near-infrared
                sky. In addition
                to providing a context for the interpretation of results obtained at infrared and other wavelengths,
                2MASS is
                providing direct answers to immediate questions on the large-scale structure of the Milky Way and the
                Local Universe.
                The 2MASS took place between 1997-2001. It executed simultaneously in two different locations: at the
                U.S.
                Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American
                Observatory

                thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared. As with all EMR, IR carries

                It was launched on November 20, 2004. The Swift observatory comprises three telescopes, which work in
                tandem to
                provide rapid identification and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRBs and their afterglows. Within 20 to
                75 seconds of
                a detected GRB, the observatory rotates autonomously, so the onboard X-ray and optical telescopes can
                view the
                burst. The afterglow phenomenon follows the initial gamma-ray flash in most bursts. It can linger in
                X-ray
                light, optical light and radio waves for hours to weeks, providing great detail and SWIFT basically aims

                NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a powerful space observatory that opens a wide window on the
                universe. Gamma rays are the highest-energy form of light, and the gamma-ray sky is spectacularly
                different from the one we perceive with our own eyes. Fermi enables scientists to answer persistent
                questions across a broad range of topics, including supermassive black-hole systems, pulsars, the origin
                of cosmic rays, and searches for signals of new physics.
                Astronomers at long last have a superior tool to study how black holes, notorious for pulling matter in,
                can accelerate jets of gas outward at fantastic speeds. Physicists are able to study subatomic particles
                at energies far greater than those seen in ground-based particle accelerators. And cosmologists are
                gaining valuable information about the birth and early evolution of the Universe.
                More technically, Fermi observes light in the photon energy range of 8,000 electronvolts (8 keV) to
                greater than 300 billion electronvolts (300 GeV). An electronvolt is a unit of energy close to that of
                visible light; Fermi observes photons with energy levels thousands to hundreds of billions of times
                greater than what the unaided eye can see.
                When launched on June 11, 2008, Fermi bore the name Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope, or GLAST. NASA
                renamed the mission that August in honor of professor Enrico Fermi (1901-1954), a pioneer in high-energy
                physics.

                The enigmatic phenomena were first seen in 1967 by a U.S. Air Force satellite called Vela. The probe was
                designed to keep watch for secret Soviet nuclear testing, but it ended up spotting dazzling gamma-rays —
                the most powerful electromagnetic radiation — coming from beyond the solar system, according to NASA.

                infrared cirrus which could be found in almost every direction of space. IRAS also revealed for the

                calibration, zero level and striping problems that can preclude its use, especially at 12 and 25 micron.
                The team of IRAS developed a new way to enhance significantly the general quality of the ISSA plates in
                the four bands (12, 25, 60 and 100 microns). This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits
                from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level compatible with DIRBE, and
                from a better destriping. At 100 micron the IRIS product is also a significant improvement from the
                Schlegel et al. (1998) maps. IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well calibrated point
                sources and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1 degree was corrected for the
                variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and brightness.
                *The DIRBE is an absolute radiometer, which measures sky brightness by chopping between the sky and a
                zero-flux internal reference at 32 Hz.
